      <p class="sectionText">This assignment was done in a class, and so the data I collected was from a lab we all participated in. We first all ‘tested’ the A version of the interface. We did this by being tasked with scheduling an appointment on a specific day, with a certain doctor. After we all did this, we were able to make changes to the website ended up being version B. Then, went around and tested each other's designs. It was the same people who tested version A that tested version B.
