        This chart displays my analysis of how organizations have designed their products and interfaces. They all have a “favorite” function, whether that be with likes or bookmarks, users are able to curate a list that they can then go and filter and sort.

            The websites I chose all have different levels of complexity when it comes to their Filter and Sort abilities. My positionality is as a user of these sites who can be biased when it comes to aesthetic interfaces and such. 
          </p>
          <p class="sectionText">
            As shown in the chart, Letterboxd had a multitude of factors however was lacking in some. Because of the interface, sometimes it was hard to gather what I could sort or filter. It’s buttons were in the corner and not very visible. Not only that but the filters seemed a bit broad. However, I will say that it does an effective job if you know what decade it is. 

          </p>
          <p class="sectionText">
            Archive of Our Own had the most factors and was only missing one “check.” Based on that alone, you could imply that it has a more complex filter and sorting ability. Being able to administer multiple filters at once is very helpful because it is effective if you have hundreds of items to look for and are searching for a select few. Sorting could be improved upon and the interface was not as “colorful” or as modern as other sites, however, it is effective since it deals with a lot of data that can be messy when having a lot of aesthetic features. 

          </p>
          <p class="sectionText">
            Spotify had the least amount of “checks” on the chart. It was only able to filter by genre, which makes sense because it is a music platform and most people are concerned with the genre, not the length as much. However, length would have been a nice feature. It had a clear visual hierarchy which makes it easy to use. The best factor of Spotify was that it was able to be sorted alphabetically.

            This website was where I was able to implement  filtering and sorting to an interface that I created using React. I created mock data of books that I then was able to filter by specific genres and sort. The link can be found here: <a href="https://csci1300-development-liart.vercel.app/">Books for Sale</a>

      <p class="sectionText">From this experience I was able to hone my analysis skills and examine how design elements impact user's abiltiy to interact with a website. And how different sites have different strengths and weaknesses which can make sense based on what their funciton and goal is as a website. I enjoyed this project because it also allowed me to practice my React skills and create a filtering and sorting application where I could implement parts of what public organizations have available. I also gained more knowledge about fornt-end development.  </p>
